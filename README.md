# JetCard adaption for Nano / Xavier NX

JetCard is a system configuration that makes it easy to get started with AI.  It comes pre-loaded with

* A Jupyter Lab server that starts on boot for easy web programming

* A script to display the Jetson's IP address (and other stats)
* The popular deep learning frameworks PyTorch and TensorFlow

After configuring your system using JetCard, you can get started prototyping AI projects from your web browser in Python.
